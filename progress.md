# Python Learning Progress

This file documents my progress through Python programming using a combination of the FutureCoder course and the roadmap.sh Python roadmap.

## ✅ Phase 1: Learn the Basics

- [x] Basic Syntax
- [x] Variables and Data Types
- [x] Conditionals (if, else, elif)
- [x] For Loops
- [ ] While Loops ← currently working on this
- [ ] Type Casting
- [ ] Exceptions
- [ ] Functions and Builtin Functions
- [ ] Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries

---

## 🧱 Phase 2: Data Structures & Algorithms

- [ ] Arrays and Linked Lists
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Heaps, Stacks and Queues
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Intermediate Python

- [ ] Modules (Builtin and Custom)
- [ ] Lambdas
- [ ] Decorators
- [ ] Iterators
- [ ] Regular Expressions

---

## 👷 Phase 4: Object Oriented Programming

- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Methods and Dunder Methods

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Concurrency

- [ ] Multiprocessing
- [ ] Asynchrony (async/await)
- [ ] Threading
- [ ] GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)

---

## 📦 Phase 6: Python Ecosystem & Tools

- [ ] Package Managers: pip, PyPI, conda, poetry
- [ ] Common Packages
- [ ] Virtual Environments: venv, pipenv, pyenv
- [ ] Static Typing: mypy, pyright, pyre
- [ ] Code Formatting: black, ruff, yapf
- [ ] Documentation: sphinx
- [ ] Testing: pytest, unittest, doctest

---

## 🌐 Phase 7: Frameworks and Specialization (Future)

- [ ] Web: Flask, Django, FastAPI
- [ ] Data Science: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- [ ] Dashboards: Plotly Dash
- [ ] Async Web Frameworks: Sanic, aiohttp
- [ ] Games: PyGame (optional)
